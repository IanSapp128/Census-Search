# Census Search
My first attempt are creating a small utility in Go. A utility that pulls up the API documentation for the table you provide it. Supported tables are **Detailed Tables**, **Subject Tables**, and **Data Profiles**.

I initially created this project as a Python script and it had helped me quickly pull up table variables when I needed them. Startup time for the script was pretty slow, so I wanted to try and make it with a compiled language. Should build on Windows, Mac, and Linux but so far only tested on Windows.
